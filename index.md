## CS 499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my capstone portfolio site. This page showcases the artifacts and enhancements I completed in CS 499 at Southern New Hampshire University. The work presented here demonstrates my growth in software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases, as well as my ability to think about security while building real applications.

## Code Review

As part of CS 499 I completed a recorded code review of my selected artifacts. In this review I walked through the existing code, explained the purpose of each project, and identified areas where design, performance, and security could be improved. The feedback from the review guided the enhancements that I completed for this capstone.

## Artifact 1 – Software Engineering and Design

**Artifact:** Android Inventory Application (CS 360)  
**Technologies:** Java, Android Studio, SQLite  

This artifact is an Android inventory application that allows users to add items, update quantities, and view stored data in a simple interface. It demonstrates my ability to design and implement a mobile application with activities, layouts, and a local database.

For the capstone enhancement I focused on improving the overall structure and quality of the code. I refactored repeated logic into helper methods, cleaned up activity classes, and improved input validation so that invalid or empty values are handled safely. I also reviewed the user interface to make it more consistent and easier to navigate. These changes make the app easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## Artifact 2 – Algorithms and Data Structures

**Artifact:** 3D Rendering Project (CS 330)  
**Technologies:** C++, OpenGL, GLSL, linear algebra  

This artifact is a 3D rendering project that creates a scene using basic shapes, lighting, textures, and camera movement. It demonstrates my ability to work with transformations, vectors, matrices, and structured code to manage a complex graphics pipeline. The project uses classes and functions to separate responsibilities such as object creation, transformations, input handling, and drawing.

For the capstone enhancement I reviewed and improved the design of the scene manager and object classes. I cleaned up how shapes and objects are stored and updated, organized transformation code so that scaling, rotation, and translation are easier to follow, and reduced repeated logic. I also focused on naming and structure so that the flow from input to camera movement to drawing is clear. These changes show my ability to apply algorithmic thinking and data structure organization in a real time graphics context.

## Artifact 3 – Databases

**Artifact:** Animal Shelter Dashboard (CS 340)  
**Technologies:** Python, MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook or dashboard framework  

This artifact is an animal shelter dashboard that connects to a MongoDB database and supports create, read, update, and delete operations on animal records. It demonstrates my ability to work with a document database and to design queries that answer real questions for users.

For the capstone enhancement I focused on improving database interactions and data validation. I reviewed queries for efficiency, added filters and sort options to make the dashboard more useful, and strengthened validation to reduce the chance of bad or incomplete data being stored. I also added clearer error messages so that users know when operations succeed or fail. These enhancements show that I can design and maintain a database backed application that is both functional and reliable.

## Professional Self Assessment

Throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University I moved from writing small individual programs to designing and maintaining complete systems. Courses in software engineering, algorithms, databases, and security taught me how to think about structure, performance, and user needs while writing code.

The artifacts on this site show that I can design and build an Android application, implement and analyze algorithms and data structures, and connect an application to a database. The enhancements I completed for CS 499 improved code quality, organization, and security across these projects. Together they demonstrate that I am prepared to contribute to real software development work, continue learning new tools, and follow professional practices such as version control, testing, and documentation.

## CS 499 Course Outcomes

### Outcome 1  
**Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.**

In my projects I use clear code structure, meaningful names, and comments so that other developers can understand and extend the work. For the capstone I also created a code review video and written documentation that explain each artifact and its enhancements. These materials support collaboration by making it easier for teammates, instructors, and future employers to see what the software does and how it can be improved.

### Outcome 2  
**Design, develop, and deliver professional quality communications that are coherent, technically sound, and adapted to specific audiences and contexts.**

The reports, diagrams, and this ePortfolio are written to be clear and accessible to both technical and nontechnical readers. In the code review video I explain the design of each artifact, why certain decisions were made, and how enhancements address issues in the original implementations. This shows that I can adapt my communication style when I am speaking to classmates, instructors, or stakeholders who may not be developers.

### Outcome 3  
**Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards.**

The course advising system demonstrates my ability to design a solution around data structures and algorithms that fit the problem. In the capstone enhancement I considered efficiency, readability, and maintainability when selecting structures and refactoring the code. I used standard programming practices such as modular design, separation of concerns, and clear function interfaces.

### Outcome 4  
**Demonstrate an ability to use well founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value.**

Across these artifacts I used tools such as Android Studio, C++ compilers, Python, MongoDB, Git, and GitHub. I applied established techniques like model view separation in the Android app, structured data storage and search in the advising system, and query design in the database project. The enhancements focused on delivering more value to users through better usability, performance, and reliability.

### Outcome 5  
**Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs.**

During the capstone enhancements I looked for ways that the software could be misused or broken by invalid inputs or unexpected behavior. I strengthened input validation in the Android application, reduced the chance of incorrect data in the advising and shelter systems, and considered how database access should be controlled. These changes show that I am starting to think about security as an important part of design rather than something that is added at the end.
