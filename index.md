## Code Review

As part of CS 499 I completed a recorded code review of my selected artifacts. In this review I walked through the existing code, explained the purpose of each project, and identified areas where design, performance, and security could be improved. The feedback from the review guided the enhancements that I completed for this capstone.

## Artifact 1 – Software Engineering and Design

**Artifact:** Android Inventory Application (CS 360)  
**Technologies:** Java, Android Studio, SQLite  

This artifact is an Android inventory application that allows users to add items, update quantities, and view stored data in a simple interface. It demonstrates my ability to design and implement a mobile application with activities, layouts, and a local database.

For the capstone enhancement I focused on improving the overall structure and quality of the code. I refactored repeated logic into helper methods, cleaned up activity classes, and improved input validation so that invalid or empty values are handled safely. I also reviewed the user interface to make it more consistent and easier to navigate. These changes make the app easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## Artifact 2 – Algorithms and Data Structures

**Artifact:** 3D Rendering Project (CS 330)  
**Technologies:** C++, OpenGL, GLSL, linear algebra  

This artifact is a 3D rendering project that creates a scene using basic shapes, lighting, textures, and camera movement. It demonstrates my ability to work with transformations, vectors, matrices, and structured code to manage a complex graphics pipeline. The project uses classes and functions to separate responsibilities such as object creation, transformations, input handling, and drawing.

For the capstone enhancement I reviewed and improved the design of the scene manager and object classes. I cleaned up how shapes and objects are stored and updated, organized transformation code so that scaling, rotation, and translation are easier to follow, and reduced repeated logic. I also focused on naming and structure so that the flow from input to camera movement to drawing is clear. These changes show my ability to apply algorithmic thinking and data structure organization in a real time graphics context.

## Artifact 3 – Databases

**Artifact:** Animal Shelter Dashboard (CS 340)  
**Technologies:** Python, MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook or dashboard framework  

This artifact is an animal shelter dashboard that connects to a MongoDB database and supports create, read, update, and delete operations on animal records. It demonstrates my ability to work with a document database and to design queries that answer real questions for users.

For the capstone enhancement I focused on improving database interactions and data validation. I reviewed queries for efficiency, added filters and sort options to make the dashboard more useful, and strengthened validation to reduce the chance of bad or incomplete data being stored. I also added clearer error messages so that users know when operations succeed or fail. These enhancements show that I can design and maintain a database backed application that is both functional and reliable.

## Professional Self Assessment

Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I moved from writing small assignments to building complete applications that solve real problems. Completing the coursework and then pulling everything together in this capstone ePortfolio helped me see how my skills connect and where I bring the most value to an employer. The capstone experience forced me to critically examine my earlier work, identify gaps, and enhance those artifacts so they better reflect the developer I am today rather than the student I was when I first wrote them.

Across the program, I consistently used projects to showcase my strengths and shape my professional goals. In CS-360, I built an Android inventory application that taught me how much I enjoy creating tools that make everyday tasks easier for users. In CS-330, I designed and implemented a 3D OpenGL scene, which strengthened my comfort with math, transformations, and structured code that runs every frame. In CS-340, I worked with MongoDB and a dashboard interface for an animal shelter, which confirmed my interest in data management and the importance of storing and presenting information clearly. Other courses, such as CS-465, where I developed a full-stack travel site, and CS-320, where I focused on unit testing and quality, helped me see that I want a career that combines software engineering, data, and a strong focus on reliability and security.

The program also gave me repeated practice collaborating in a team environment and communicating with different stakeholders. Peer feedback in discussion boards required me to explain design decisions, review other people’s code, and accept suggestions on my own work. The capstone code review continued this pattern by asking me to talk through my code as if I were presenting it to another developer or a hiring manager. Writing this ePortfolio and my enhancement reports required me to switch from technical language to language that a non-technical stakeholder can understand. That combination of teamwork, written communication, and presentation skills will help me contribute to real development teams where ideas and tradeoffs need to be discussed clearly.

From a technical standpoint, the program strengthened my understanding of data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. Courses like CS-300 and CS-330 required me to think carefully about how data is stored, how fast operations need to be, and how structure and algorithms affect performance. Courses in software engineering and web development taught me to separate concerns, design clean interfaces between components, and use tools like version control and testing frameworks. Database work in CS-340 and other classes gave me experience designing queries, validating input, and handling persistent data safely. Security topics appeared throughout the curriculum and in this capstone, where I improved input validation, considered error handling, and thought about how an attacker or careless user might try to break the system.

The three artifacts in this ePortfolio fit together to show the range of my computer science abilities. The Android inventory application showcases my software engineering and design skills, as well as my ability to build a usable front end that communicates with a structured back end. The CS-330 OpenGL project highlights my understanding of algorithms, data organization, and math in a graphical, real-time environment. The CS-340 animal shelter dashboard demonstrates my ability to work with databases, handle real data, and provide meaningful ways to search, filter, and update records. Together with the reflection in this professional self-assessment, these artifacts tell a complete story: I can design, implement, test, and explain software that is maintainable, data-driven, and built with a security mindset. This ePortfolio serves as both a record of my growth and a starting point for my career in the computer science field.

## CS 499 Course Outcomes

### Outcome 1  

In my projects I use clear code structure, meaningful names, and comments so that other developers can understand and extend the work. For the capstone I also created a code review video and written documentation that explain each artifact and its enhancements. These materials support collaboration by making it easier for teammates, instructors, and future employers to see what the software does and how it can be improved.

### Outcome 2  

The reports, diagrams, and this ePortfolio are written to be clear and accessible to both technical and nontechnical readers. In the code review video I explain the design of each artifact, why certain decisions were made, and how enhancements address issues in the original implementations. This shows that I can adapt my communication style when I am speaking to classmates, instructors, or stakeholders who may not be developers.

### Outcome 3  

The course advising system demonstrates my ability to design a solution around data structures and algorithms that fit the problem. In the capstone enhancement I considered efficiency, readability, and maintainability when selecting structures and refactoring the code. I used standard programming practices such as modular design, separation of concerns, and clear function interfaces.

### Outcome 4  

Across these artifacts I used tools such as Android Studio, C++ compilers, Python, MongoDB, Git, and GitHub. I applied established techniques like model view separation in the Android app, structured data storage and search in the advising system, and query design in the database project. The enhancements focused on delivering more value to users through better usability, performance, and reliability.

### Outcome 5  

During the capstone enhancements I looked for ways that the software could be misused or broken by invalid inputs or unexpected behavior. I strengthened input validation in the Android application, reduced the chance of incorrect data in the advising and shelter systems, and considered how database access should be controlled. These changes show that I am starting to think about security as an important part of design rather than something that is added at the end.
